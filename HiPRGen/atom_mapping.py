    Get the atom mapping between the reactants and products of a reaction.

    This works for reactions with any number of reactant/product molecules, provided
    that the reaction is stoichiometrically balanced. This implementation respects atom
    type and the connection between atoms, and ignore other information like bond type
    (e.g. single vs double) as well and stereo centers.

    There could be multiple mappings (due to, e.g. symmetry in molecules and the fact
    that bond type is not considered), and this function only returns one such mapping.

    The algorithm treats the reactants as a single disjoint graph (same for the products)
    and using integer programming to find the smallest number of bond edits to transform
    the reactant graph to the product graph. See the paper in `Reference` for details of
    the algorithm.

    Args:
        reactants: reactant molecules
        products: product molecules
        max_bond_change: maximum number of allowed bond changes (break and form) between
            the reactants and products.
        msg: whether to show the integer programming solver running message to stdout.
        threads: number of threads for the integer programming solver.

    Returns:
        reactants_map_number: rdkit style atom map number for the reactant molecules
            (starting from 1 in rdkit but from 0 here). Each dict holds the map number
            for one molecule {atom_index: map_number}. This should be used together
            with `products_map_number` to determine the correspondence of atoms.
            Atoms in the reactants and products having the same map number corresponds
            to each other in the reaction. For example, given
            `reactants_map_number=[{0:3, 1:0}, {0:2, 1:1}]` and
            `products_map_number = [{0:1}, {0:0, 1:2, 2:3}]`, we can conclude that
            atom 0 in reactant molecule 0 maps to atom 2 in product molecule 1 (both
            with map number 3);
            atom 1 in reactant molecule 0 maps to atom 0 in product molecule 1 (both
            with map number 0);
            atom 0 in reactant molecule 1 maps to atom 1 in product molecule 1 (both
            with map number 2);
            atom 1 in reactant molecule 1 maps to atom 0 in product molecule 0 both
            with map number 1).
        products_map_number: rdkit style atom map number for the product molecules.
            See `reactants_map_number` for more.
